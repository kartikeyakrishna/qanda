Assume that you build a document–term matrix M (rows: documents; columns: words) and take its thin SVD M = U Σ Vᵀ. Which statement is most accurate for interpreting V in classical Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA)?
 Columns of V (and rows of Vᵀ) give low-dimensional word representations that capture co-occurrence similarity.
 V gives only document embeddings, words are in U.
 V and U are not orthonormal in LSA.
 Σ can be ignored without affecting similarity.
Yes, the answer is correct.

Accepted Answers:

Which statements correctly characterize the basic DistMult approach for knowledge graph completion?
 Each relation 𝑟 is parameterized by a full D×D matrix that can capture asymmetric relations.
 The relation embedding is a diagonal matrix, leading to a multiplicative interaction of entity embeddings.
 DistMult struggles with non-symmetric relations because score(s, r, o) = asT Mr ao is inherently symmetric in s and o.
 DistMult’s performance is typically tested only on fully symmetric KGs.
Yes, the answer is correct.

 MMᵀ: document–document similarity via shared terms
 Both are identity matrices by construction
 MᵀM counts how often a word appears in the corpus total
Yes, the answer is correct.

Which best describes the main advantage of using a factorized representation (e.g., DistMult, ComplEx) for large KGs?
 It enforces that every relation in the KG be perfectly symmetric.
 It ensures each entity is stored as a one-hot vector, simplifying nearest-neighbour queries.
 It collapses the entire KG into a single scalar value.
 It significantly reduces parameters and enables generalization to unseen triples by capturing low-rank structure.
Yes, the answer is correct.

Which statement best describes the reshaping of a 3D KG tensor X ∈R|E|×|R|×|E| into a matrix factorization problem?
 One axis remains for subject, one axis remains for object, and relations are combined into a single expanded axis.
 The subject dimension is repeated to match the relation dimension, resulting in a 2D matrix.
 Each subject–relation pair is collapsed into a single dimension, while objects remain as separate entries.
 The entire KG is vectorized into a 1D array and then factorized with an SVD approach.
No, the answer is incorrect.

Accepted Answers:
Each subject–relation pair is collapsed into a single dimension, while objects remain as separate entries.

SimplE addresses asymmetry by:
 Using separate subject and object embeddings per entity and including inverse relations, with an averaged score over the two directions
 Constraining relation vectors to unit modulus
 Replacing dot-products by max-pooling
 Removing inverse relations entirely

Which of the following statements correctly describe hyperbolic (Poincare) embeddings for hierarchical data?
 They map nodes onto a disk (or ball) such that large branching factors can be represented with lower distortion than in Euclidean space.
 Distance grows slowly near the center and becomes infinite near the boundary, making it naturally suited for tree-like structures.
 They require each node to be embedded on the surface of the Poincare disk of radius 1.
 They can achieve arbitrarily low distortion embeddings for trees with the same dimension as Euclidean space.
Yes, the answer is correct.

Why might a partial-order-based approach (like order embeddings) be beneficial for modelling ‘is-a’ relationships compared to purely distance-based approaches?
 They explicitly encode the ancestor–descendant relation as a coordinate-wise inequality or containment.
 They can represent negative correlations (i.e., sibling vs. ancestor) more easily than distance metrics.
 They inherently guarantee transitive closure of the hierarchy in the learned embedding space.
 They do not rely on pairwise distances but use a notion of coordinate-wise ordering or interval containment.
No, the answer is incorrect.

Which statement about box embeddings in hierarchical modelling is most accurate?
 Each entity or type is assigned a single real-valued vector, ignoring bounding volumes.
 Containment Ix ⊆ Iy all dimensions encodes x≺y .
 They rely on spherical distances around a central node to measure tree depth.
 They cannot be used to represent set intersections or partial overlap.
Yes, the answer is correct.
Score: 1
Accepted Answers:
Containment Ix ⊆ Iy all dimensions encodes x≺y .

For order embeddings with axis-aligned open cones:
 Represent each item x by apex ux ; encode x ≺ y as ux ≥ uy (element-wise).
 Positive loss encourages all dimensions to satisfy the order ; negative loss enforces at least one dimension to violate it.
 All cones (and their intersections) have the same measure in this construction.
 This makes modeling negative correlation between sibling types difficult.
Partially Correct.
